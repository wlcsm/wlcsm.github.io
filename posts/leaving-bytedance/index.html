<p>Note that I haven&rsquo;t actually leaft ByteDance at the moment, but just are now clear that this is what I want to do.</p>
<p>This was brought about after I was invited to go on a business trip to America for 2 and a half months, my girlfriend thought that this was perhaps way too long and remarked that if I work there for nearly three months, then I may as we just work there. I don&rsquo;t need to consider this as a great opportunity as I could actually just be working there and getting a lot more money than I would be here. And then we realised why are we staying here? Our goal was for my to come so that we could reunite. But now we have acheived that goal, so there is nothing stopping us going back.</p>
<p>Though I was a little hesitant as I grew a bit comfortable in my job (and this busness trip was a big thing), I staarted redoing my resume. This was a rare time that I actually had a decent amount of time on the weekend to do it, and so I decided to redo my latex resume in Groff for the challenge of it. This made me relise how much I enjoying doing this again, just spending hours learning some new technology, figuruing it out myself. In the end I was quite confident in my decision to leave, and I realised I would actuall have the free time to do more of this later in a job in Australia</p>
