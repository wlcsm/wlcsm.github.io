      <description>I spend pretty much all my time in the terminal. After some time, I find I can navigate just as fast, if not faster there than in a GUI file browser.
I used to use the ultra-lightweight nnn terminal file browser, but even that I found unnecessary other than being very nice to look at.
The one feature that I missed however, was bulk renaming files in my editor. When you press r in nnn, it brings up the files in the directory in the program specified in your $EDITOR variable, with numbers next to them.</description>
