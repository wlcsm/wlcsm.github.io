      <description>Email My email setup is a little complicated because I maintain a local copy of my mail on my computer for backup reasons. It is also nice because it is faster. I use Neomutt which is a terminal based email client. This is because I like the minimalism and I just think that email is something that is so fundamental that it should be in a terminal. I have tried other lightweight clients like Sylpheed and I still prefer it.</description>
