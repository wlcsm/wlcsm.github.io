I have found that doing a side project scratched the itch I had for programming

This was quite unexpected as I always thought programming was the thing I enjoyed the most, the end. But now I feel free to use it as a means to an end.

This had a surprise benfit of saving me from doing a potentially unhappy PhD. I always had a love for pure mathematics. The elegance and perfection in it has also strongly shaped my programming style, in perhaps an unhelpful way. 

When I thought about considering continuing in the industry, I felt like I was missing out, this was perhaps my only chance to persue a PhD in maths, as the brain becomes much harder to do maths  the older you get. I also really liked learning about it. Having 4-6 years to devote myself to it sounded great. But at the same time I felt a part of my mind pull in the other direction. Thinking of studying maths had the seratonin, but thinking "what about afterwards", did not. 

There were many things making me want to do a phd:
1. Maths is currently the thing I am best at
2. Maths is one of my greatest joys
3. It is something in which I have the greatest chance of getting a "great opportunity" e.g. getting into a top university
4. It is the thing I am used to

Point 4 seems small but is actually quite big. Change is hard, your rat brain is wired to avoid change when things are going well. It is the easy choice. And so I also have acknowledged my own personal bias in my decission not to persue a phd as I have felt the urge dissapate over my time working, which a factor would be that my life now is going pretty well, and a PhD would be a very big shake up to  it as I would need to move overseas yet again (I am currently in China at TikTok), and I would also probably not go back to Australia either, which would make things easier.

Despite looking through topics to do a PhD on and seeing the broard directions and getting exciting about number theory/algebraic geometry. Looking into concrete projects was less interesting. I couldn't seem to find someting of great interest, and nothing that I felt I would be ready to commit to for such a long time.

I was then strongly considering the American system since it gives about 2 years of coursework before you actually start a PhD. This would give me time to evaluate my options, explore what I'm interested and find it, right? But ever since this realisation I believe this was somewhat of a delusion. Delaying making a decision and hoping that I will be guided to one by the process(the 2 years study curriculm). This is still an indefinate path and now I believe was delaying the enevitable. This was potentially a very big and very very expensive trap.

This most deciding thinking that I did, was that I separated my love, enjoyment, curiousity for maths, from that of my true satisfaction. I realised that when I thought I studying maths, I was exciting, this would be so fun and interesting to do! But why can't I find a goal? Because I realised that I like the *process* in maths. I like obtaining the soluation as much as the path there for sure. But I found this had only a small bearing on my sense of self-fulfillment. I posed the question to myself, imagine I had gotten a PhD, and even solved a great unsolved problem, like I mean quite great (get you into the newspapers great but not Millenimum math prize great), hell imagine I even got a Fields medal (even with my hubris I don't consider this). And then consider if I didn't do a PhD, and intead I worked for a while, maybe got a masters in Computer science (or maths), and I worked on a renewable electricty project to save wildlife or bring electricity to poor areas. Which would I choose?

I felt not even a moment of hesitantion towards the latter. This quite surprised my as to how unimportant the former felt to me. The thing is is that, there are a great number of people who would choose the former and this is okay, I am 100% onboard with people for that dream, I know people with this dream and I can really understand why they have this dream too. But this was a pretty big wakeup call for me that I need to reevaluate my direction. The second question is that will doing a PhD help me achieve that goal? The answer is pretty much no, I really don't think it will. PhD prepares you for research, its also a pretty draining process that only the commited can endure. About everything I know has said the last year is hell, and all they care about is "just finishing it". Not to say this is bad but I honestly don't think this process will help. And I really don't like the idea of doing a PhD in a project that I am not at least 99% certain in. So when it comes to making my own company, or even devloping a new technology, I'm really don't think a PhD will help. I have done many research projects along with mostly self-guided Honours project, I think I will be fine. 

However, maths is an itch that I really cannot help but scratch. The thought of not being able to continue it is one of the main things that pushed me consider moving into academia in the first place. But I now feel that I would be happy to continue to persue it privately with my own recreational learning.


An additional affect this has had is that it has made me feel like I can do things now. I've started taking interest in more things. Since I no longer see this period as an intermediary state between big stages in my life, I feel like: "this is now the start of the rest of my life", it feels a bit more real now. Maybe I didn't pay as much attention to the things around me as I always felt that this is temporary, I will start a phd soon enough, theres no time to look into it now, or even that it will not make a difference if i look into it now.

I don't want to have the impression that making plans for the future is detremental, on the contrary, it is so necessary. But I think this is a pitfall that I now will be mindful of and to avoid later on.

## What next

The idea of a Master's is still on the table and is something I am currently exploring. Maths or comp sci would both be fine, as long as the maths is focused toward comp sci. To me I think it will largely depend on the university that I am looking at. My university's bachelors in maths is quite strong, we took courses on measure theory, algebraic topology/geometry, differential geometry pitched at the level of many graduate courses (which is why only about 10-15 people graduate with an honours in maths in ANU each year). For this reason maths might be difficult to go into, or maybe fruitless as I may need to go so head deep into the maths that it will then be a pure maths degree that still doesn't help me acheive my goals. 

However I am not a rushed to do a Master's as a was with a PhD. I would be fine to do it within the next couple of years.

The goals would be to:
* Increase job prospects (as much as a personally hate this, titles matter to many of the people above you)
* Explore the areas a bit, have some more time to get interested in topics beyong the curriculum
* Network

On networking,  as much as a hate to admit it, networking is probably one of the most valuable things you will get out of university. I am not very social and so in my bachelors I didn't do much, mainly focused on not drowning. But after reflecting and working for some time, I see this is a big thing that I missed out on. There are three big benefits:
1. The number of "contacts" you will have in the industry, unfortuanly in many industries (yes, even tech) this is the *only* way to get into some roles. And it will almost certainly be of great benefit always.
2. The other is you see what other people are doing. I didn't if know that I needed to plan that far ahead for my PhD, I thought at the end of the year I could start looking but when I asked my firends they had all started more than a year in advance. I didn't even know, don't even know how we didn't talk about it more. They will receommend different events you didn't know about, people you didn't know. My girlfriend found out that pretty much everyone in the class where copying solutins from GitHub that previous students put up, or weekend schools. She didn't partake in them but it was interesting to know about
3. They can help you in your work. I always had an attitude of figuring out things for myself for the entire degree. This gave me great problem solving abilities that will help me for the rest of my life. But sometimes, especially in software, your just hurting yourself if your not asing other people. Solutations don't really have a logic path to their solutions and even fi  you do spend the day doing it,  you really have not gained anything having done so. I noticed this was a big problem for my in my work at TikTok, I would prefer to solve things by myself but it reality the reason it wasn't working was because I didn't add a internal HTTP header that *was not documented anywhere* or the downstream service has some weird quirks that everyone just works around. This lead me to getting behind on  deadline before I learnt to ask *a lot* of questions. Another example is a brillant student in on of my classes that I was the workshop demonstrator for. He pretyt much knew everything to know. But he also was decently social and hung around with the computer science student association. When I marks his assignment he mentions that his solution was based off a recommendation from someone in the association. He did several of his own solutions and showed empricially that they were all far inferiors. I kind of realised that even he, something that could definately solve any problem by himself found great inspiration from others here.
